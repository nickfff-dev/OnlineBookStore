## Challenge

### Problem Statement

The main problem the Online Bookstore project is intended to solve is the inconvenience and expense associated with buying books traditionally. With the rise of digital technology, online bookstores have become increasingly popular. However, there are still limitations and challenges associated with online bookstores that need to be addressed.

### Limitations

Despite the advantages of online bookstores, such as convenience and a wide range of books, several limitations need to be acknowledged. These include:
High Prices: Some online bookstores charge significantly higher prices for textbooks compared to physical bookstores, which can be a barrier for many students 5.
Accessibility: Not everyone has reliable internet access, which can limit their ability to shop from online bookstores. Additionally, the process of buying books online can be more complicated and stressful than going to a physical bookstore, especially for those who are not comfortable with technology 5.
Lack of Flexibility: Once a book is ordered, it cannot be returned or exchanged unless the seller offers a return policy. This contrasts with physical bookstores where customers can try out a book before buying it 5.
Technical Issues: Online bookstores can sometimes have technical issues that make purchasing difficult. For example, some students have reported difficulties with registering for accounts or having their card payments declined 5.

## Target Users

The primary target audience for the Online Bookstore project is students who need to purchase textbooks for their courses. The project could also be useful for educators looking for a convenient way to purchase textbooks for their classes.

## Relevance

This project is relevant worldwide as it addresses a global issue faced by many students - the high cost of textbooks. However, it's worth noting that the effectiveness of the online bookstore would depend on the user's comfort level with technology and their access to a stable internet connection.
